# Commonly used 4-Apps in website.
   In phones we make folders based on their use,such that we can access them easily when it is necessary.
   similar to that I've got an idea to make 4-Apps in a website-> Mini Calender,Calculator,Notes, Clock.

# Description:
   In this website,A 4 boxes will be displayed with names of the app,by clicking on it,we will be directed to the respective webpage. If we have to use in a easier way  to know about the present date in calender ,and for  Arithmetic calculations and to type any note and to see current time.


## Technologies used :
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   3. JavaScript
