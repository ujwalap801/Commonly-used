# Commonly used 4-Apps in website.
   In phones we make folders based on their use,such that we can access them easily when it is necessary.
   similar to that I've got an idea to make 4-Apps in a website-> Mini Calender,Calculator,Notes, Clock.

# Description:
   In this website,A 4 boxes will be displayed with names of the app,by clicking on it,we will be directed to the respective webpage.so that if we have to use in a easier way to know about the  calender, or to calculate, and to want to see the notes we created and see time currently.
## Technologies used :
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   3. JavaScript

# Learnings:
  As a beginner in learning web development, by doing this project i've got much knowledge where i kept all from learned skills here.
  I preferred JavaScript:DOM because i want to know the things working from initiate,which makes  my skills strong.
